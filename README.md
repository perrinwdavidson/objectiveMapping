# About
Here we present an algorithm for objective mapping in N dimensions in MATLAB. The source code is in the subdirectory `src/objectiveMapping.m` with the neccessary subroutines to run the function in `src/subroutines/*`. Examples in 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensions are provided in the subdirectory `scripts/*`, which can be run if the `src` subdirectory is added to the MATLAB path.
